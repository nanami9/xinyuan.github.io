My name is Xinyuan Luo. I'm a master's student in [Autonomy and Robotics](https://autonomy.illinois.edu/meng) at [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu), advised by [Prof. Wenzhen Yuan](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/yuanwz). My research interests lie in robot perception, manipulation and tactile sensing.

I received my Bachelor of Engineering from [the School of Sensing Science and Technology](https://ssse.sjtu.edu.cn) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn), advised by [Prof. Hongbing Li](http://www.ie.sjtu.edu.cn/Data/View/266).
